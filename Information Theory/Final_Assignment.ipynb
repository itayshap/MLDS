    "the rationale of M2F transformation is that it a symbol  is replaced by its index in the stack of “recently used symbols”. As a result, long sequences of identical symbols are replaced by as many zeroes, whereas when a symbol that has not been used in a long time appears, it is replaced with a large number. if there is correlation between some symbols then these symbols tend to be converted to have smaller integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, MTF transformation takes advantage of local correlation of frequencies to reduce the entropy of a message. if the sequence exhibits local correlations, the transformation will result in a large number of small numbers such as \"0\"'s and \"1\"'s in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Huffman coding, on the other hand, takes into account the distribution of the data, awarding smaller codewords for more frequent symbols/sequence, but it does not address the local correlations as MTF transformation.\n",
    "As such, combining MTF and Huffman coding together utilizes advantages of each of the algorithms, creating a better two-tier compression scheme.  "
